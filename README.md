Project Overview
In this project, I built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains information from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were primarily conducted via phone calls. The goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit ('yes') or not ('no').

Number of Instances: 41,188 (full dataset)
Number of Attributes: 20
Target Variable: deposit (binary classification: 'yes' or 'no')
Files in the Project
bank-full.csv: The main dataset containing all the instances and attributes.
decision_tree_model.py: The Python script used to preprocess the data, build the decision tree classifier, and evaluate its performance.
README.md: This documentation file.
Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy: For numerical operations
matplotlib: For data visualization
seaborn: For advanced data visualization
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms
Steps Followed

Data Preprocessing:
Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Renamed the target column y to deposit for clarity.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Building:
Built a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.
Trained the model on the training set.

Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's accuracy on the test set.
Visualized the decision tree using plot_tree.
Confusion matrix and other metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the model.
Model Accuracy
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Visualization
The project also includes visualizations like the decision tree and a confusion matrix to better understand the model's decisions.

How to Run the Project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script:
python decision_tree_model.py
Results and Insights
The decision tree model provides an interpretable way to understand customer behavior and predict term deposit subscriptions.
Visualizations like the tree and confusion matrix offer further insights into how the model makes decisions.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of decision tree classifiers for binary classification problems in marketing datasets. The insights derived from the model can help in improving marketing strategies by better targeting customers likely to subscribe to term deposits.
